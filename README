My personal repository conforming to the KISS Linux standard. Any package I
don't have the will to keep updated will be deleted from this repository
without warning.


dbus:
	dbus and bluez(-alsa). The most up-to-date repository of these packages
	of those searched by kiss-find.

extra:
	Mostly python packages and their dependencies, as well as some media
	libraries and tools.

modified:
	My own forks from other repos. Should obviously not be used as is
	unless you happen to have the same needs and file system as me.


Every commit is signed with my GPG key, which has the fingerprint:

5BAF 496C CC19 1FBA 1938  4D4E A68B 10E2 554D EBCB


Everything here should be reasonably safe, as many builds were inspired by or
copied nearly verbatim from Arch or Alpine. Still, use at your own risk.
