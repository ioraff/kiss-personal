My personal repository conforming to the KISS Linux standard. Any package I
don't have the will to keep updated will be deleted from this repository
without warning.


dbus:
	dbus and bluez(-alsa). The most up-to-date repository of these packages
	of those searched by kiss-find.

extra:
	Various. Packages dependent on SSL/TLS are dependent on the ssl/ 
	repository.

modified:
	Forks of packages from other repositories, with all unmodified files
	symlinked to the parent repository.

old:
	Unmaintained packages

ssl:
	libressl and (libtls-)bearssl. Packages that would otherwise depend on
	openssl are modified so as to work with bearssl if possible, and
	or libressl otherwise.


Every commit is signed with my GPG key, which has the following fingerprint:

Everything here should be reasonably safe, as many builds were inspired by or
copied nearly verbatim from Arch or Alpine. Still, use at your own risk.
