My personal repository conforming to the KISS Linux standard. Any package I
don't have the will to keep updated will be deleted from this repository
without warning.


dbus:
	dbus and bluez(-alsa). The most up-to-date repository of these packages
	of those searched by kiss-find.

extra:
	Mostly numerical packages and their dependencies, as well as some media
	libraries and tools.

modified:
	Forks of packages from other repositories, with all unmodified files
	symlinked to the parent repository.

old:
	Unmaintained packages, moved from extra/.

ssl:
	Port of some packages to a different ssl library.  This typically has
	involved nothing more than changing the depends file from openssl to
	libressl.  Packages that support bearssl use that instead, and packages
	that support libtls use that instead of libssl so as to use
	libtls-bearssl.


Every commit is signed with my GPG key, which has the following fingerprint:

Everything here should be reasonably safe, as many builds were inspired by or
copied nearly verbatim from Arch or Alpine. Still, use at your own risk.
